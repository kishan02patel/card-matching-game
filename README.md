# Card Matching Game

## Description

This game is a memory game as well as a learning game that helps you improve your focus and memory power. Unlike every card matching game in which you have to find the similar card from the deck, this game wants to find question and answer pair from the cards. 

Suppose initially the game starts with 6 cards then out of 6, 3 would have question relating to basic maths or animal photos, fruit photos and the remaining half would have answer related to those question like animal names or fruit name. So here you don't have to find a matching pair but you have to find the card thats related to other card. It's very fun to play and yet a challenging game as you have to remember the card and its position.
